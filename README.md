# Restaurant
An Android app for ordering food in a restaurant. It has a login screen with the ability to create new accounts and has a functional cart. Menu and cart items are displayed using RecyclerView.

The accounts are stored in an SQL database and includes details like email, name and password.
The menu has a tabbed layout with different categories of food.
There is a navigation drawer for quick navigation around the app and for logging out.

Things Left to do:

1) Configure Navigation drawer to show current username and email. Currently displays pre-defined values.
2) Overhaul login screen to make it look better
3) Change button icons to better match material guidelines
4) Overhaul cart page to make it look better
