# Restaurant
An Android app for ordering food in a restaurant. It has a login screen with the ability to create new accounts and a functional cart. Menu and cart items are displayed using RecyclerView.

Things Left to do:

1) Configure Navigation drawer to show current username and email. Currently displays pre-defined values.
2) Overhaul login screen to look better
3) Change button icons to better match material guidelines
4) Overhaul cart page to look better
